# Common Request Headers<a name="api-common-request-headers"></a>

Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) REST requests include headers that contain basic information about the request\. The following table describes headers that can be used by all S3 Glacier REST requests\.


| Header Name | Description | Required | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Authorization |  The header that is required to sign requests\. S3 Glacier requires Signature Version 4\. For more information, see [Signing Requests](amazon-glacier-signing-requests.md)\. Type: String  | Yes | 
| Content\-Length |  The length of the request body \(without the headers\)\. Type: String Condition: Required only for the [Upload Archive \(POST archive\)](api-archive-post.md) API\.   | Conditional | 
| Date |  The date that can be used to create the signature contained in the `Authorization` header\. If the `Date` header is to be used for signing it must be specified in the ISO 8601 basic format\. In this case, the `x-amz-date` header is not needed\. Note that when `x-amz-date` is present, it always overrides the value of the `Date` header\. If the Date header is not used for signing, it can be one of the full date formats specified by [RFC 2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.3), section 3\.3\. For example, the following date/time `Wed, 10 Feb 2017 12:00:00 GMT` is a valid date/time header for use with S3 Glacier\.  If you are using the `Date` header for signing, then it must be in the ISO 8601 basic `YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'` format\.  Type: String Condition: If `Date` is specified but is not in ISO 8601 basic format, then you must also include the `x-amz-date` header\. If `Date` is specified in ISO 8601 basic format, then this is sufficient for signing requests and you do not need the `x-amz-date` header\. For more information, see [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Glossary*\.   | Conditional  | 
| Host |  This header specifies the service endpoint to which you send your requests\. The value must be of the form "`glacier.region.amazonaws.com`", where *region* is replaced with an AWS Region designation such as `us-west-2`\. Type: String  | Yes | 
| x\-amz\-content\-sha256 |  The computed SHA256 checksum of an entire payload that is uploaded with either [Upload Archive \(POST archive\)](api-archive-post.md) or [Upload Part \(PUT uploadID\)](api-upload-part.md)\. This header is not the same as the `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` header, though, for some small payloads the values are the same\. When `x-amz-content-sha256` is required, both `x-amz-content-sha256` and `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` must be specified\. Type: String Condition: Required for streaming API, [Upload Archive \(POST archive\)](api-archive-post.md) and [Upload Part \(PUT uploadID\)](api-upload-part.md)\.  | Conditional | 
| x\-amz\-date |  The date used to create the signature in the Authorization header\. The format must be ISO 8601 basic in the `YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'` format\. For example, the following date/time `20170210T120000Z` is a valid `x-amz-date` for use with S3 Glacier\. Type: String Condition: `x-amz-date` is optional for all requests; it can be used to override the date used for signing requests\. If the `Date` header is specified in the ISO 8601 basic format, then `x-amz-date` is not needed\. When `x-amz-date` is present, it always overrides the value of the `Date` header\. For more information, see [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Glossary*\.   | Conditional | 
| x\-amz\-glacier\-version |  The S3 Glacier API version to use\. The current version is `2012-06-01`\. Type: String  | Yes | 
| x\-amz\-sha256\-tree\-hash |  The computed SHA256 tree\-hash checksum for an uploaded archive \([Upload Archive \(POST archive\)](api-archive-post.md)\) or archive part \([Upload Part \(PUT uploadID\)](api-upload-part.md)\)\. For more information about calculating this checksum, see [Computing Checksums](checksum-calculations.md)\. Type: String Default: None Condition: Required for [Upload Archive \(POST archive\)](api-archive-post.md) and [Upload Part \(PUT uploadID\)](api-upload-part.md)\.  | Conditional |
