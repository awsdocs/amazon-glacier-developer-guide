# Configuring Vault Notifications Using the Amazon S3 Glacier Console<a name="configuring-notifications-console"></a>

This section describes how to configure vault notifications using the Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) console\. When you configure notifications, you specify job completion events that trigger notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic\. In addition to configuring notifications for the vault, you can also specify a topic to publish notification to when you initiate a job\. If your vault is configured to notify for a specific event and you specify notification in the job initiation request, then two notifications are sent\.

Follow the steps in [Subscribe to a Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/gsg/Subscribe.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide* to subscribe to a new topic\.
