# Step 5: Delete an Archive from a Vault in S3 Glacier<a name="getting-started-delete-archive"></a>

In this step, you'll delete the sample archive that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in S3 Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md)\. 

**Important**  
You cannot delete an archive by using the Amazon S3 Glacier console\. Any archive operation, such as upload, download, or deletion, requires you to use the AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\) or write code\. To upload data, such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS SDKs\.  
To install the AWS CLI, see [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\. For more information about using S3 Glacier with the AWS CLI, see [AWS CLI Reference for S3 Glacier](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/glacier/index.html)\. For examples of using the AWS CLI to upload archives to S3 Glacier, see [Using S3 Glacier with the AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-glacier.html)\.
