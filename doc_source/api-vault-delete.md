# Delete Vault \(DELETE vault\)<a name="api-vault-delete"></a>

## Description<a name="api-vault-delete-description"></a>

This operation deletes a vault\. Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as per the last inventory and there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory\. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails \(that is, the vault is not removed\) and S3 Glacier returns an error\. 

You can use the [Describe Vault \(GET vault\)](api-vault-get.md) operation that provides vault information, including the number of archives in the vault; however, the information is based on the vault inventory S3 Glacier last generated\.

This operation is idempotent\.

**Note**  
When you delete a vault, the vault access policy attached to the vault is also deleted\. For more information about vault access policies, see [Vault Access Policies](vault-access-policy.md)\.

## Requests<a name="api-vault-delete-requests"></a>

To delete a vault, send a `DELETE` request to the vault resource URI\.

### Syntax<a name="api-vault-delete-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. DELETE /AccountId/vaults/VaultName HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

 

**Note**  
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault\. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' \(hyphen\), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens \('\-'\) in the ID\.
