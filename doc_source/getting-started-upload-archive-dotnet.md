# Upload an Archive to a Vault in S3 Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="getting-started-upload-archive-dotnet"></a>

The following C\# code example uses the high\-level API of the AWS SDK for \.NET to upload a sample archive to the vault\. In the code example, note the following:

 
+ The example creates an instance of the `ArchiveTransferManager` class for the specified Amazon S3 Glacier Region endpoint\.
+ The code example uses the US West \(Oregon\) Region \(`us-west-2`\)\. 
+ The example uses the `Upload` API operation of the `ArchiveTransferManager` class to upload your archive\. For small archives, this operation uploads the archive directly to S3 Glacier\. For larger archives, this operation uses the multipart upload API operation in S3 Glacier to split the upload into multiple parts for better error recovery, if any errors are encountered while streaming the data to S3 Glacier\.

For step\-by\-step instructions on how to run the following example, see [Running Code Examples](using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-dotnet)\. You must update the code as shown with the name of your vault and the name of the archive file to upload\.  

**Note**  
S3 Glacier keeps an inventory of all the archives in your vaults\. When you upload the archive in the following example, the archive will not appear in a vault in the management console until the vault inventory has been updated\. This update usually happens once a day\.
