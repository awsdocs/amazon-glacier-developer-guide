# Complete Vault Lock \(POST lockId\)<a name="api-CompleteVaultLock"></a>

## Description<a name="api-CompleteVaultLock-description"></a>

This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the `InProgress` state to the `Locked` state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable\. A vault lock is put into the `InProgress` state by calling [Initiate Vault Lock \(POST lock\-policy\)](api-InitiateVaultLock.md)\. You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling [Get Vault Lock \(GET lock\-policy\)](api-GetVaultLock.md)\. For more information about the vault locking process, see [S3 Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md)\. 

This operation is idempotent\. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the `Locked` state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault\.

If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the `Locked` state, the operation returns an `AccessDeniedException` error\. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state, the operation throws an `InvalidParameter` error\.

## Requests<a name="api-CompleteVaultLock-requests"></a>

To complete the vault locking process, send an HTTP `POST` request to the URI of the vault's `lock-policy` subresource with a valid lock ID\.

### Syntax<a name="api-CompleteVaultLock-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy/lockId HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. Content-Length: Length
6. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

**Note**  
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID\. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' \(hyphen\), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens \('\-'\) in the ID\.

 The `lockId` value is the lock ID obtained from a [Initiate Vault Lock \(POST lock\-policy\)](api-InitiateVaultLock.md) request\.
