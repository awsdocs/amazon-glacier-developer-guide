# Describe Vault \(GET vault\)<a name="api-vault-get"></a>

## Description<a name="api-vault-get-description"></a>

This operation returns information about a vault, including the vault Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), the date the vault was created, the number of archives contained within the vault, and the total size of all the archives in the vault\. The number of archives and their total size are as of the last vault inventory Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) generated \(see [Working with Vaults in Amazon S3 Glacier](working-with-vaults.md)\)\. S3 Glacier generates vault inventories approximately daily\. This means that if you add or remove an archive from a vault, and then immediately send a Describe Vault request, the response might not reflect the changes\. 

## Requests<a name="api-vault-get-requests"></a>

To get information about a vault, send a `GET` request to the URI of the specific vault resource\.

### Syntax<a name="api-vault-get-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. GET /AccountId/vaults/VaultName HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

 

**Note**  
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault\. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' \(hyphen\), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens \('\-'\) in the ID\.
