# Abort Vault Lock \(DELETE lock\-policy\)<a name="api-AbortVaultLock"></a>

## Description<a name="api-AbortVaultLock-description"></a>

This operation stops the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the `Locked` state\. If the vault lock is in the `Locked` state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an `AccessDeniedException` error\. Stopping the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault\. 

A vault lock is put into the `InProgress` state by calling [Initiate Vault Lock \(POST lock\-policy\)](api-InitiateVaultLock.md)\. A vault lock is put into the `Locked` state by calling [Complete Vault Lock \(POST lockId\)](api-CompleteVaultLock.md)\. You can get the state of a vault lock by calling [Get Vault Lock \(GET lock\-policy\)](api-GetVaultLock.md)\. For more information about the vault locking process, see [S3 Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md)\. For more information about vault lock policies, see [Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies](vault-lock-policy.md)\.

This operation is idempotent\. You can successfully invoke this operation multiple times, if the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state or if there is no policy associated with the vault\.

## Requests<a name="api-AbortVaultLock-requests"></a>

To delete the vault lock policy, send an HTTP `DELETE` request to the URI of the vault's `lock-policy` subresource\.

### Syntax<a name="api-AbortVaultLock-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. DELETE /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01

**Note**  
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID\. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' \(hyphen\), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens \('\-'\) in the ID\.
