# Retrieving S3 Glacier Archives<a name="downloading-an-archive-two-steps"></a>

Retrieving an archive from Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) is an asynchronous operation in which you first initiate a job, and then download the output after the job completes\. To initiate an archive retrieval job you use the [Initiate Job \(POST jobs\)](api-initiate-job-post.md) REST API or the equivalent in the AWS CLI, or Amazon SDKs\.

Retrieving an archive from S3 Glacier is a two\-step process\.

**To retrieve an archive**

1. Initiate an archive retrieval job\.

   1. Get the ID of the archive that you want to retrieve\. You can get the archive ID from an inventory of the vault\. This can be done with the REST API, AWS CLI, or Amazon SDKs\. For more information, see [Downloading a Vault Inventory in Amazon S3 Glacier](vault-inventory.md)\. 

   1. Initiate a job requesting S3 Glacier to prepare an entire archive or a portion of the archive for subsequent download by using the [Initiate Job \(POST jobs\)](api-initiate-job-post.md) operation\. 

   When you initiate a job, S3 Glacier returns a job ID in the response and runs the job asynchronously\. \(You cannot download the job output until after the job completes as described in Step 2\.\)
**Important**  
For Standard retrievals only, a data retrieval policy can cause your initiate retrieval job request to fail with a `PolicyEnforcedException` exception\. For more information about data retrieval policies, see [Amazon S3 Glacier Data Retrieval Policies](data-retrieval-policy.md)\. For more information about the `PolicyEnforcedException` exception, see [Error Responses](api-error-responses.md)\.

   When required, you can restore large segments of the data stored in S3 Glacier\. For example, you might want to restore data for a secondary copy\. However, if you need to restore a large amount of data, keep in mind that S3 Glacier is designed for 35 random restore requests per pebibyte \(PiB\) stored per day\. 

   For more information about restoring data from these storage classes, see [ Amazon S3 Storage Classes for Archiving Objects]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-glacier) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*\.

1. After the job completes, download the bytes using the [Get Job Output \(GET output\)](api-job-output-get.md) operation\. 

   You can download all bytes or specify a byte range to download only a portion of the job output\. For larger output, downloading the output in chunks helps in the event of a download failure, such as a network failure\. If you get job output in a single request and there is a network failure, you have to restart downloading the output from the beginning\. However, if you download the output in chunks, in the event of any failure, you need only restart the download of the smaller portion and not the entire output\. 

S3 Glacier must complete a job before you can get its output\. After completion, a job will not expire for at least 24 hours after completion, which means you can download the output within the 24\-hour period after the job is completed\. To determine if your job is complete, check its status by using one of the following options:
+ **Wait for a job completion notification —** You can specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic to which S3 Glacier can post a notification after the job is completed\. S3 Glacier sends notification only after it completes the job\.

  You can specify an Amazon SNS topic for a job when you initiate the job\. In addition to specifying an Amazon SNS topic in your job request, if your vault has notifications configuration set for archive retrieval events, then S3 Glacier also publishes a notification to that SNS topic\. For more information, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier](configuring-notifications.md)\.
+ **Request job information explicitly —** You can also use the S3 Glacier describe job operation \([Describe Job \(GET JobID\)](api-describe-job-get.md)\) to periodically poll for job information\. However, we recommend using Amazon SNS notifications\.

**Note**  
The information you get by using SNS notification is the same as what you get by calling Describe Job\. 

## Archive Retrieval Options<a name="api-downloading-an-archive-two-steps-retrieval-options"></a>

You can specify one of the following when initiating a job to retrieve an archive based on your access time and cost requirements\. For information about retrieval pricing, see the [S3 Glacier Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/)\.
+ **Expedited —** Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent\-Tiering Archive Access tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required\. For all but the largest archives \(250 MB\+\), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes\. Provisioned Capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it\. For more information, see [Provisioned Capacity](#api-downloading-an-archive-two-steps-retrieval-expedited-capacity)\. 
+ **Standard —** Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archives within several hours\. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3–5 hours\. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option\.
+ **Bulk —** Bulk retrievals are S3 Glacier’s lowest\-cost retrieval option, which you can use to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day\. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5–12 hours\.

To make an Expedited, Standard, or Bulk retrieval, set the `Tier` parameter in the [Initiate Job \(POST jobs\)](api-initiate-job-post.md) REST API request to the option you want, or the equivalent in the AWS CLI or Amazon SDKs\. If you have purchased provisioned capacity, then all expedited retrievals are automatically served through your provisioned capacity\. 

### Provisioned Capacity<a name="api-downloading-an-archive-two-steps-retrieval-expedited-capacity"></a>

Provisioned capacity helps ensure that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals is available when you need it\. Each unit of capacity provides that at least three expedited retrievals can be performed every five minutes and provides up to 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput\.

You should purchase provisioned retrieval capacity if your workload requires highly reliable and predictable access to a subset of your data in minutes\. Without provisioned capacity Expedited retrievals are accepted, except for rare situations of unusually high demand\. However, if you require access to Expedited retrievals under all circumstances, you must purchase provisioned retrieval capacity\. 

#### Purchasing Provisioned Capacity<a name="downloading-an-archive-purchase-provisioned-capacity"></a>

You can purchase provisioned capacity units by using the S3 Glacier console, the [Purchase Provisioned Capacity \(POST provisioned\-capacity\)](api-PurchaseProvisionedCapacity.md) REST API, the Amazon SDKs, or the AWS CLI\. For provisioned capacity pricing information, see [S3 Glacier Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/)\. 

A provisioned capacity unit lasts for one month starting at the date and time of purchase, which is the start date\. The unit expires on the expiration date, which is exactly one month after the start date to the nearest second\. 

If the start date is on the 31st day of a month, the expiration date is the last day of the next month\. For example, if the start date is August 31, the expiration date is September 30\. If the start date is January 31, the expiration date is February 28\.

 To use the S3 Glacier console to purchase provisioned capacity, choose **Settings** and then choose **Provisioned capacity**\.

After your purchase has succeeded, you can choose **Buy** again to purchase additional capacity units\. When you are finished, choose **Close**\. 

## Ranged Archive Retrievals<a name="downloading-an-archive-range"></a>

When you retrieve an archive from S3 Glacier, you can optionally specify a range, or portion, of the archive to retrieve\. The default is to retrieve the whole archive\. Specifying a range of bytes can be helpful when you want to do the following:
+ **Manage your data downloads** – S3 Glacier allows retrieved data to be downloaded for 24 hours after the retrieval request completes\. Therefore, you might want to retrieve only portions of the archive so that you can manage the schedule of downloads within the given download window\.
+ **Retrieve a targeted part of a large archive** – For example, suppose you have previously aggregated many files and uploaded them as a single archive, and now you want to retrieve a few of the files\. In this case, you can specify a range of the archive that contains the files you are interested in by using one retrieval request\. Or, you can initiate multiple retrieval requests, each with a range for one or more files\.

When initiating a retrieval job using range retrievals, you must provide a range that is megabyte aligned\. In other words, the byte range can start at zero \(the beginning of your archive\), or at any 1 MB interval thereafter \(1 MB, 2 MB, 3 MB, and so on\)\. 

The end of the range can either be the end of your archive or any 1 MB interval greater than the beginning of your range\. Furthermore, if you want to get checksum values when you download the data \(after the retrieval job completes\), the range you request in the job initiation must also be tree\-hash aligned\. Checksums are a way you can ensure that your data was not corrupted during transmission\. For more information about megabyte alignment and tree\-hash alignment, see [Receiving Checksums When Downloading Data](checksum-calculations-range.md)\.
