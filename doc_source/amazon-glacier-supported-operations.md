# Supported Operations in S3 Glacier<a name="amazon-glacier-supported-operations"></a>

To work with vaults and archives \(see [Amazon S3 Glacier Data Model](amazon-glacier-data-model.md)\), Amazon S3 Glacier supports a set of operations\. Among all the supported operations, only the following operations are asynchronous: 
+ Retrieving an archive
+ Retrieving a vault inventory \(list of archives\)

These operations require you to first initiate a job and then download the job output\. The following sections summarize the S3 Glacier operations\.

## Vault Operations<a name="vault-ops-intro"></a>

S3 Glacier provides operations to create and delete vaults\. You can obtain a vault description for a specific vault or for all vaults in an AWS Region\. The vault description provides information, such as the creation date, the number of archives in the vault, the total size in bytes used by all the archives in the vault, and the date that S3 Glacier generated the vault inventory\. S3 Glacier also provides operations to set, retrieve, and delete a notification configuration on the vault\. For more information, see [Working with Vaults in Amazon S3 Glacier](working-with-vaults.md)\.

## Archive Operations<a name="archive-ops-intro"></a>

S3 Glacier provides operations for you to upload and delete archives\. You cannot update an existing archive; you must delete the existing archive and upload a new archive\. Each time that you upload an archive, S3 Glacier generates a new archive ID\. For more information, see [Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier](working-with-archives.md)\.

## Jobs<a name="job-ops-intro"></a>

You can initiate an S3 Glacier job to perform a retrieval on an archive or get an inventory of a vault\.

The following are the types of S3 Glacier jobs: 
+ `archive-retrieval` – Retrieve an archive\. 

  For more information, see [Downloading an Archive in S3 Glacier](downloading-an-archive.md)\.
+ `inventory-retrieval` – Inventory a vault\.
