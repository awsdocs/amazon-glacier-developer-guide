# Delete an Archive from a Vault in S3 Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for Java<a name="getting-started-delete-archive-java"></a>

The following code example uses the AWS SDK for Java to delete the archive\. In the code, note the following:

 
+ The `DeleteArchiveRequest` object describes the delete request, including the vault name where the archive is located and the archive ID\.
+ The `deleteArchive` API operation sends the request to Amazon S3 Glacier to delete the archive\. 
+ The example uses the US West \(Oregon\) Region \(`us-west-2`\)\. 

For step\-by\-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon S3 Glacier Using Eclipse](using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java)\. You must update the code as shown with the archive ID of the file that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in S3 Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md)\.
