# Download an Archive from a Vault in S3 Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for Java<a name="getting-started-download-archive-java"></a>

The following Java code example uses the high\-level API of the AWS SDK for Java to download the archive that you uploaded in the previous step\. In the code example, note the following:
+ The example creates an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class\. 
+ The code uses the US West \(Oregon\) Region \(`us-west-2`\) to match the location where you created the vault in [Step 2: Create a Vault in S3 Glacier](getting-started-create-vault.md)\. 
+ The example uses the `download` API operation of the `ArchiveTransferManager` class from the high\-level API of the AWS SDK for Java\. The example creates an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic, and an Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) queue that is subscribed to that topic\. If you created an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) admin user as instructed in [Step 1: Before You Begin with S3 Glacier](getting-started-before-you-begin.md), your user has the necessary IAM permissions for the creation and use of the Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queue\.

For step\-by\-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon S3 Glacier Using Eclipse](using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java)\. You must update the code as shown with the archive ID of the file that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in S3 Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md)\.
