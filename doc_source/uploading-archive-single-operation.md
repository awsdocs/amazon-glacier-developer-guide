# Uploading an Archive in a Single Operation<a name="uploading-archive-single-operation"></a>

As described in [Uploading an Archive in Amazon S3 Glacier](uploading-an-archive.md), you can upload smaller archives in a single operation\. However, we encourage Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) customers to use Multipart Upload to upload archives greater than 100 MB\.
