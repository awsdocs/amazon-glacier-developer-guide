# Initiate Vault Lock \(POST lock\-policy\)<a name="api-InitiateVaultLock"></a>

## Description<a name="api-InitiateVaultLock-description"></a>

This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the following: 
+ Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault\.
+ Setting the lock state of vault lock to `InProgress`\.
+ Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process\. 

You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20 KB in size\. For more information about vault lock policies, see [Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies](vault-lock-policy.md)\.

You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock enters the `InProgress` state\. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the `InProgress` state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the vault\. You call [Complete Vault Lock \(POST lockId\)](api-CompleteVaultLock.md) to complete the vault locking process by setting the state of the vault lock to `Locked`\. 

**Note**  
After a vault lock is in the `Locked` state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock for the vault\.

You can stop the vault locking process by calling [Abort Vault Lock \(DELETE lock\-policy\)](api-AbortVaultLock.md)\. You can get the state of the vault lock by calling [Get Vault Lock \(GET lock\-policy\)](api-GetVaultLock.md)\. For more information about the vault locking process, see [S3 Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md)\.

If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state, the operation returns an `AccessDeniedException` error\. When the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state you must call [Abort Vault Lock \(DELETE lock\-policy\)](api-AbortVaultLock.md) before you can initiate a new vault lock policy\. 

## Requests<a name="api-InitiateVaultLock-requests"></a>

To initiate the vault locking process, send an HTTP `POST` request to the URI of the `lock-policy` subresource of the vault, as shown in the following syntax example\.

### Syntax<a name="api-InitiateVaultLock-requests-syntax"></a>

```
 1. POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
 2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com

10. }
```

 

**Note**  
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID\. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' \(hyphen\), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens \('\-'\) in the ID\.
