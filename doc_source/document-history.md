|  Expedited and Bulk Data Retrievals  |  S3 Glacier now supports Expedited and Bulk data retrievals in addition to Standard retrievals\.

|  Vault tagging  |  S3 Glacier now allows you to tag your S3 Glacier vaults for easier resource and cost management\. Tags are labels that you can define and associate with your vaults, and using tags adds filtering capabilities to operations such as AWS cost reports\. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources](tagging.md) and [Tagging Your S3 Glacier Vaults](tagging-vaults.md)\.  |  June 22, 2015  | 
|  Vault access policies  |  S3 Glacier now supports managing access to your individual S3 Glacier vaults by using vault access policies\. You can now define an access policy directly on a vault, making it easier to grant vault access to users and business groups internal to your organization, as well as to your external business partners\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies](vault-access-policy.md)\.  |  April 27, 2015  | 
|  Data retrieval policies and audit logging  |  S3 Glacier now supports data retrieval policies and audit logging\. Data retrieval policies allow you to easily set data retrieval limits and simplify data retrieval cost management\. You can define your own data retrieval limits with a few clicks in the AWS console or by using the S3 Glacier API\. For more information, see [S3 Glacier Data Retrieval Policies](data-retrieval-policy.md)\. In addition, S3 Glacier now supports audit logging with AWS CloudTrail, which records S3 Glacier API calls for your account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. For more information, see [Logging Amazon S3 Glacier API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](audit-logging.md)\.  |  December 11, 2014  | 
|  Updates to Java samples  |  Updated the Java code samples in this guide that use the AWS SDK for Java\.  |  June 27, 2014  | 
|  Limiting vault inventory retrieval  |  You can now limit the number of vault inventory items retrieved by filtering on the archive creation date or by setting a limit\.
