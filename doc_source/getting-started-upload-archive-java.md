# Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier Using the AWS SDK for Java<a name="getting-started-upload-archive-java"></a>

The following Java code example uses the high\-level API of the AWS SDK for Java to upload a sample archive to the vault\. In the code example, note the following:
+ The example creates an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class\. 
+ The example uses the `upload` method of the `ArchiveTransferManager` class from the high\-level API of the AWS SDK for Java\. 
+ The example uses the US West \(Oregon\) Region \(`us-west-2`\) to match the location where you created the vault previously in [Step 2: Create a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier](getting-started-create-vault.md)\.

For step\-by\-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon S3 Glacier Using Eclipse](using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java)\. You need to update the code as shown with the name of the archive file you want to upload\.

**Note**  
Amazon S3 Glacier \(S3 Glacier\) keeps an inventory of all the archives in your vaults\. When you upload the archive in the following example, it will not appear in a vault in the management console until the vault inventory has been updated\. This update usually happens once a day\.
