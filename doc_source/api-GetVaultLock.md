# Get Vault Lock \(GET lock\-policy\)<a name="api-GetVaultLock"></a>

## Description<a name="api-GetVaultLock-description"></a>

This operation retrieves the following attributes from the `lock-policy` subresource set on the specified vault: 
+ The vault lock policy set on the vault\.
+ The state of the vault lock, which is either `InProgess` or `Locked`\.
+ When the lock ID expires\. The lock ID is used to complete the vault locking process\.
+ When the vault lock was initiated and put into the `InProgress` state\.

A vault lock is put into the `InProgress` state by calling [Initiate Vault Lock \(POST lock\-policy\)](api-InitiateVaultLock.md)\. A vault lock is put into the `Locked` state by calling [Complete Vault Lock \(POST lockId\)](api-CompleteVaultLock.md)\. You can stop the vault locking process by calling [Abort Vault Lock \(DELETE lock\-policy\)](api-AbortVaultLock.md)\. For more information about the vault locking process, see [S3 Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md)\.

If there is no vault lock policy set on the vault, the operation returns a `404 Not found` error\. For more information about vault lock policies, see [Vault Lock Policies](vault-lock-policy.md)\.

## Requests<a name="api-GetVaultLock-requests"></a>

To return the current vault lock policy and other attributes, send an HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the vault's `lock-policy` subresource as shown in the following syntax example\.

### Syntax<a name="api-GetVaultLock-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. GET /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

 

**Note**  
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault\. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' \(hyphen\), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request\. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens \('\-'\) in the ID\.

### Example Request<a name="api-GetVaultLock-example-request"></a>

In this example, a `GET` request is sent to the URI of a vault's `lock-policy` subresource\.

```
1. GET /-/vaults/examplevault/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
3. x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z
4. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
5. Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE/20141123/us-west-2/glacier/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-amz-glacier-version,Signature=9257c16da6b25a715ce900a5b45b03da0447acf430195dcb540091b12966f2a2
